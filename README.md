# jQuery CSS Extender

jQuery CSS Extender is a jQuery plugin which adds many CSS-relative methods. Its first goal was to read CSS-formated strings using the `.css()` method. Once done, I have had other ideas that I decided to implement.

## Installation

First download the repository from here.

Then, in order to have readable errors in development, include the source file in your HTML file :

```html
<script src="your/path/to/jquery-css-extender.js"></script>
```

Or if your are in production, use the minify one :

```html
<script src="your/path/to/jquery-css-extender.min.js"></script>
```
